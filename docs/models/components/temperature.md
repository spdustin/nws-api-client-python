# Temperature

High/low temperature for the period, depending on whether the period is day or night. This property as an integer value is deprecated. Future versions will express this value as a quantitative value object. To make use of the future standard format now, set the "forecast_temperature_qv" feature flag on the request.


## Supported Types

### `components.QuantitativeValue`

```python
value: components.QuantitativeValue = /* values here */
```

### `int`

```python
value: int = /* values here */
```
